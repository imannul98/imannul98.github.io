About the Project:
I use Design Option 2: Scrollytelling. The information I am trying to convey through this project is to show how does property and violent crime rate has been going, especially in the state of Georgia. I analyze the maximum crime rate for both of them, and add some animation to it. I also add comparison between the crime rate in Georgia and other states. 

Key Features:
1. Scrolling.
2. Highlighting Animation (Applicable only for visualization 1, 2, and 3).
3. Tooltip (Applicable only for visualization 1 and 2).
