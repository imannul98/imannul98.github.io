                    <p>Property Crime Rate in Georgia</p>
                    <b>As shown in the graph, property-related crime in Georgia was increasing until 1989, reaching a peak of 6,337.3. Since then, the trend has gradually declined.</b>

                    <p>Violent Crime Rate in Georgia</p>
                    <b>The same is true for violent crime. It increased until 1990 and then gradually decreased over the years. This suggests that significant reforms in public safety in the late 1980s and early 1990s caused the crime rates for both property and violent offenses to cease increasing around that time.</b>

                    <p>How About the Property & Violent Crime Rates in 2019?</p>
                    <b>As shown in the scatterplot, with the exception of Washington D.C., the crime rates in all states fall within the range of 100 to 1,000 for violent crime and 1,000 to 3,500 for property crime.</b>

                    <p>How Does Georgia Compare?</p>
                    <b>Georgia is right there in the middle. So I guess we are not too bad, compared to other states.</b>
